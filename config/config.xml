		<ul style="list-style-type:none;">
			<li><p><span style="color:blue;">3 friends</span> = Mavet Rosas, Patrick McMann, and Derrick Fyfield.</p></li>
			<li><p><span style="color:red;">9 days</span> = July 7th 2017 ~ July 16th 2017.</p></li>
			<li><p><span style="color:green;">6000+ miles</span> = Maryland to California ... and back!</p></li>

		<h1> Why!? </h1>
		<p>
			In May, 2017 Pat and Derrick were talking about Tequila! Why, you ask? Porque no? 
			While talking about some good tequila that Pat owned, they mentioned that they could just GO to Mexico to get some! Derrick responded by suggesting that they could DRIVE to Mexico!
		</p>
		<br/>
		<p>
			This was only a partially kidding idea. Then, Patrick brought up the fact that Emily Maginnis was also going to be in California for that summer! So, they could drive to Cali and then to Mexico. Pat then suggested that they invite Mavet since she was available! Mavet was in! A plan was formed!
		</p>
		<br/>
		<p>
			In less than 1 week, they had the idea <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1DQPd7nc5XlEIq-Xjb_gdxLUvWze6_lEo5eBAwK5j5Lc/preview" target="_blank">on "paper"</a>, and they started hashing out the schedule! And in a little over 1 month, they hit the road!
		</p>
		<br/>
		<p>
			Almost 2 years later, they finally got around to editing and sharing their experiences from that trip! Hope you enjoy watching them as much as they enjoyed making them!
		</p>
		<br/>
		<p style="font-style:italic">
			ps: Pat coined the term "Motherfucking Road Trip" - hence, the name of this page!
